# A Simple CRD (no U... (yet)!) app built with React.
Uses Javascript/ JSX and plain CSS to style up some reusable components for a playful widget to add and remove users. Media queries added to play nice on devices and change up the color palette to something more bubblegum 🍬
## To future generations:
> App structure does not follow best practices end-to-end and could definitely be more modular with smaller components! But since this is sort of just a toy, I let it slide this time... 🤫
